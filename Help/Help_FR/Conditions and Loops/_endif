Name:
endif -- ends an if-statement

Synopsis: 
if (...) then 
  ... 
endif 

Description:
The endif-statement closes (or ends) an if-statement.
Note, that endif may be written in a variety of other ways: end if, end-if or even fi. The endif-statement must be omitted, if the if-statement does not contain the keyword then (see the example below). Such an if-statement without endif extends only over a single line.

Example:
input "A number please: " a 
if (a<10) then 
	print "Your number is less than 10." 
endif 

rem  and now without endif 

input "A number please: " a 
if (a<10) print "Your number is less than 10."
