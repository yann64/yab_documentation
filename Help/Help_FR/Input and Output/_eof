Name:
eof -- check, if an open file contains data

Synopsis: 
open 1,"foo.bar" 
if (eof(1)) then 
   ... 
end if 

Description:
The eof-function checks, if there is still data left within an open file. As an argument it expects the file-number as returned by (or used within) the open-function (or statement).

Example:
a=open("foo.bar") 
while(not eof(a)) 
	input #a,a$ 
	print a$ 
end while 
Explanation:

This example will print the contents of the file "foo.bar". The eof-function will terminate the loop, if there is no more data left within the file.
