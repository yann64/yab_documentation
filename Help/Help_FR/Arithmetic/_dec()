Name:
dec() -- convert a base 2 or base 16 number into decimal form

Synopsis:
a=dec(number$) 
a=dec(number$,base) 

Description:
The dec-function takes the string-representation of a base-2 or base-16 (which is the default) number and converts it into a decimal number. The optional second argument (base) might be used to specify a base other than 16. However, currently only base 2 or base 16 are supported.

Example:

print a$," is ",dec(a$)
