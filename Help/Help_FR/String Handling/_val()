Name:
val() -- converts a string to a number

Synopsis:
x=val(x$) 

Description:
The val-function checks, if the start of its string argument forms a floating point number and then returns this number. The string therefore has to start with digits (only whitespace infront is allowed), otherwise the val-function returns zero.

Example:
input "Please enter a length, either in inches (in) or centimeters (cm) " l$ 
if (right$(l$,2)="in") then 
	l=val(l$)*2.51 
else 
	l=val(l$) 
endif
print "You have entered ",l,"cm." 
Explanation:

This example queries for a length and checks, if it has been specified in inches or centimeters. The length is then converted to centimeters.
