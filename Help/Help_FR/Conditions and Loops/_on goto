Name:
on goto -- jump to one of many goto-targets

Synopsis: 
on a goto foo,bar,baz 
  ... 
label foo 
  ... 
label bar 
  ... 
label baz 
  ... 

Description:
The on goto statement uses its numeric argument (the one between on and goto to select an element from the list of labels, which follows after the goto-keyword: If the number is 1, the execution continues at the first label; if the number is 2, at the second, and so on. if the number is zero or less, the program continues at the position of the first label; if the number is larger than the total count of labels, the execution continues at the position of the last label; i.e. the first and last label in the list constitute some kind of fallback-slot.

Note, that (unlike the goto-command) the on goto-command can no longer be considered state of the art; people may (not me!) even start to mock you, if you use it.

Example:
label over 
print "Please Select one of these choices: "
print 
print "  1 -- show time" 
print "  2 -- show date" 
print "  3 -- exit" 
print 
input "Your choice " a 
on a goto over,show_time,show_date,terminate,over 

label show_time 
	print time$() 
goto over 

label show_date 
	print date$() 
goto over 

label terminate 
exit 
Explanation:

Note, how invalid input (a number less than 1, or larger than 3) is automatically detected; in such a case the question is simply issued again.
