Name:
and() -- the bitwise arithmetic and

Synopsis:
 x=and(a,b) 

Description:
Used to compute the bitwise and of both its argument. Both arguments are treated as binary numbers (i.e. a series of 0 and 1); a bit of the resultingvalue will then be 1, if both arguments have a 1 at this position in their binary representation.
Note, that both arguments are silently converted to integer values and that negative numbers have their own binary representation and may leadto unexpected results when passed to and.

Example:
print and(6,3) 
Explanation:
          
  This will print 2. This result is clear, if you note, that the binary representation of 6 and 3 are 110 and 011 respectively; this will yield 010 in binary representaion or 2 as decimal.
