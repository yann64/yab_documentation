Name:
; -- suppress the implicit newline after a print-statement

Synopsis: 
print "foo",bar; 

Description:
The semicolon (';') may only appear at the last position within a print-statement. It supresses the implicit newline, which yab normally adds after each print-statement.

Put another way: Normally the output of each print-statement appears on a line by itself. If you rather want the output of many print-statements to appear on a single line, you should end the print-statement with a semicolon.

Example:
print "Hello ":print "World!" 
Explanation:

This example prints Hello World! in a single line.
