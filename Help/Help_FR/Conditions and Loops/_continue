Name:
continue -- start the next iteration of a for-, do-, repeat- or while-loop

Synopsis:
continue

Description:
You may use continue within any loop to start the next iteration immediately. Depending on the type of the loop, the loop-condition will or will not be checked. Especially: for- and while-loops will evaluate their respective conditions, do- and repeat-loops will not.
Remark: Another way to change the flow of execution within a loop, is the break-command.

Example:
for a=1 to 100 
	if mod(a,2)=0 continue 
	print a 
next a 
Explanation:

  This example will print all odd numbers between 1 and 100.
