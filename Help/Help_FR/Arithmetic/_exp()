Name:
exp() -- compute the exponential function of its single argument

Synopsis:
 foo=exp(bar) 

Description:
This function computes e to the power of its argument, where e is the well known euler constant 2.71828182864. The exp-function is the inverse of the log-function.

Example:
window open 100,100 to 300,300, "Example", "Example"
for x=-100 to 100 
	draw dot x,100-100*exp(x/100)/euler, "Example"
next x 
sleep 5
window close "Example"
Explanation:

This program plots part of the exp-function, however the range is rather small, so that you may not recognize the function from this plot.
