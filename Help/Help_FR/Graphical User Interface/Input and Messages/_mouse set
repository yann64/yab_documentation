Option$ = "Hide" -- hide the mouse cursor
Option$ = "Show" -- show the mouse cursor
Option$ = "Obscure" -- hide the mouse cursor until the mouse is moved 
Option$ = "CROSSHAIR" -- change the mouse cursor to a crosshair icon
Option$ = "CROSSHAIR2"  -- change the mouse cursor to a crosshair icon
Option$ = "FACE"  -- change the mouse cursor to a face icon
Option$ = "CLOCK1"  -- change the mouse cursor to a clock icon
Option$ = "CLOCK2" -- change the mouse cursor to a clock icon
Option$ = "CLOCK3" -- change the mouse cursor to a clock icon
Option$ = "CLOCK4" -- change the mouse cursor to a clock icon
Option$ = "CLOCK5" -- change the mouse cursor to a clock icon
