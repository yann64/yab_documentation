Name:
break -- breaks out of a switch statement or a loop

Synopsis:
break

Description:
break transfers control immediately outside the enclosing loop or switch statement. This is the preferred way of leaving a such a statement (rather than goto, which is still possible in most cases).

Example:
for a=1 to 10 
	break 
	print "Hi" 
next a 

while(1) 
	break 
	print "Hi" 
wend 

repeat 
	break 
	print "Hi" 
until(0) 

switch 1 
	case 1:break 
	case 2:case 3:print "Hi" 
end switch 
Explanation:

  This example prints nothing at all, because each of the loops (and the switch-statement) does an immediate break (before it could print any "Hi").
