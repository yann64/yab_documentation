Name:
on goto -- jump to one of multiple gosub-targets

Synopsis: 
on a gosub foo,bar,baz 
  ... 
label foo 
  ... 
return 

label bar 
  ... 
return 

label baz 
  ... 
return 

Description:
The on gosub statement uses its numeric argument (the one between on and gosub) to select an element from the list of labels, which follows after the gosub-keyword: If the number is 1, the program does a gosub to the first label; if the number is 2, to the second and, so on. if the number is zero or less, the program continues at the position of the first label; if the number is larger than the total count of labels, the execution continues at the position of the last label; i.e. the first and last label in the list constitute some kind of fallback-slot.

Note, that the on gosub-command can no longer be considered state of the art; people (not me!) may even start to mock you, if you use it.

Example:
do 
	print "Please enter a number between 1 and 3: "
	print 
	input "Your choice " a 
	on a gosub bad,one,two,three,bad 
loop 

label bad 
	print "No. Please between 1 and 3" 
return 

label one 
	print "one" 
return 

label two 
	print "two" 
return 

label three 
	print "three" 
return 
Explanation:

Note, how invalid input (a number less than 1, or larger than 3) is automatically detected.
