Name:
input -- read input from the user (or from a file) and assign it to a variable

Synopsis: 
input a 
input a,b,c 
input a$ 
input "Hello" a 
input #1 a$ 

Description:
input reads the new contents of one or many (numeric- or string-) variables, either from the keyboard (i.e. from you) or from a file. An optional first string-argument specifies a prompt, which will be issued before reading any contents.

If you want to read from an open file, you need to specify a hash ('#'), followed by the number, under which the file has been opened.

Note, that the input is split at spaces, i.e. if you enter a whole line consisting of many space-seperated word, the first input-statement will only return the first word; the other words will only be returned on subsequent calls to input; the same applies, if a single input reads multiple variables: The first variable gets only the first word, the second one the second word, and so on. If you don't like this behaviour, you may use line input, which returns a whole line (including embedded spaces) at once.

Example:
input "Please enter the name of a file to read: " a$ 
open 1,a$ 
while(!eof(1)) 
	input #1 b$ 
	print b$ 
wend
