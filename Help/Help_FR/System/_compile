Name:
compile -- compile a string with yab-code on the fly

Synopsis:
compile(code$)

Description:
This is an advanced command (closely related with the execute-command). It allows you to compile a string of yab-code (which is the only argument). Afterwards the compiled code is a normal part of your program.
Note, that there is no way to remove the compiled code.

Example:
compile("sub mysub(a):print a:end sub") 
mysub(2) 
Explanation:

This example creates a function named mysub, which simply prints its single argument.
