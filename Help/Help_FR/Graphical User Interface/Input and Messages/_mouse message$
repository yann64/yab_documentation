Name:
mouse message$ --  Returns the state of the mouse related to the application.
  

Synopsis:
Mouse$ = MOUSE MESSAGE$

Description:
This command is somewhat a duplicate to mouse message$(). However, it does not require a view to be given, but reports the name of the view back as part of the message Mouse$. 

The mouse string has the format  VIEW:X:Y:LMB:MMB:RMB  where VIEW is the View$ the mouse is over, MB is the corresponding left, middle, right mousebutton. X and Y are relative to the VIEW returned.
