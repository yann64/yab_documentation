Name:
thread get -- get the thread identification for a team or program

Synopsis:
Id = THREAD GET Option$, Program$

Description:
For more advanced control of the running threads, this command provides you with ID a given program named Program$. Option$ can be set as follows:

Option$ = "TeamID" -- returns the team ID for the program named Program$. Specify the whole path with parameters (only the first 64 characters are important) for the team, the ID of the first team with this path and parameters will be returned.

Option$ = "ThreadID" -- returns the thread ID for the program named Program$. Specify the program name, the ID of the first thread with this name will be returned. 

Thread get will return -1 when the program was not found. This helps you to find out whether a program e.g. started with the system command is still running or not.

Note: Using thread get is much better than trying to parse "ps" from the command line.

Example:
print thread get "teamid", "/boot/home/config/bin/yab"
print thread get "threadid", "yab"
Explanation:

The first statement prints the team ID number of the first yab program running. The second statement prints the first thread ID of the first yab program running. Note: The team ID takes the whole path while the thread ID only takes the program name.
