Name:
using -- Specify the format for printing a number

Synopsis: 
print a using "##.###" 
print a using("##.###",",.") 

Description:
The using-keyword may appear as part of the print-statement and specifies the format (e.g. the number of digits before and after the decimal dot), which should be used to print the number.

The possible values for the format argument ("##.###" in the synopsis above) are described within the entry for the str$-function; especially the second line in the synopsis (print a using("##.###",",.")) will become clear after referring to str$. In fact the using clause is closely related to the str$-function; the former can always be rewritten using the latter; i.e. print foo using bar$ is always equivalent to print str$(foo,bar$). Therefore you should check out str$ to learn more.

Example:
for a=1 to 10 
	print sqrt(ran(10000*a)) using "#########.#####" 
next a 
Explanation:

This example prints a column of square roots of random number, nicely aligned at the decimal dot.
