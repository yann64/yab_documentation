Name:
pause -- pause, sleep, wait for the specified number of seconds

Synopsis: 
pause 5 

Description:
The pause-command has many different names: You may write pause, sleep or wait interchangable; whatever you write, yab will always do exactly the same.

The pause-command will simply wait for the specified number of seconds. This may be a fractional number, so you may well wait less than a second. However, if you try to pause for a smaller and smaller interval (e.g. 0.1 seconds, 0.01 seconds, 0.001 seconds and so on) you will find that at some point yab will not wait at all.
The pause-command cannot be interrupted. However, sometimes you may want the wait to be interuptible by simply pressing a key on the keyboard. In such cases you should consider using the inkey$-function, with a number of seconds as an argument).

Example:
deg=0 
do 
	maxx=44+40*sin(deg) 
	for x=1 to maxx 
		print "*" 
	next x 
	pause 0.1+(maxx*maxx/(4*84*84)) 
	print 
	deg=deg+0.1 
loop 
Explanation:

This example draws a sine-curve; due to the pause-statement the speed of drawing varies in the same way as the speed of a ball might vary, if it would roll along this curve under the influence of gravity.
