Name:
boxview -- a boxview is view with a labeled border

Synopsis:
BOXVIEW x1,y1 TO x2,y2, ID$, Label$, LineType, View$

Description:
This command sets up a view named ID$ with a border and a label.  While the boxview is constructed at the coordinates (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) on the view named View$, the own coordinates of a boxview start at (x1+3,y1+12) to (x2-3,y2-3) so that the border can not be overwritten. This is independent of the line type.

If Label$ is not "", it will be displayed on the upper left corner of the boxview. Otherwise no label is shown.

There are three possible line types for the border style:
  For LineType = 0 the boxview has no border.
  For LineType = 1 the boxview has a simple line border.
  For LineType = 2 the boxview has a fancy line border.

Other than commands like stackview, tabview or splitview, you can simply remove a boxview just as a normal view with the view remove command.

Layout:
The boxview will follow all sides as in standard layout.

Design:
Use boxviews to group similar entries. Do not use too much boxviews in a window, as this looks too cluttered.

Example:
window open 100,100 to 300,300, "Example", "Example"
boxview 10,10 to 190,190, "MyBox", "Hello Box", 2, "Example"
sleep 7
window close "Example"
Explanation:

The example opens a window and sets up a boxview with the label "Hello Box" and a fancy border style (2).
