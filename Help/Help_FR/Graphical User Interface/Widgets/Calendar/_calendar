Name:
calendar -- create a new calendar

Synopsis:
CALENDAR x,y, ID$, Format$, SetDate$, View$

Description:
Calendar is a nifty widget that gives you a date textcontrol with a dropdown calendar window. It is created at (x,y) as upper left corner on the view View$. With the default font size, it always has a width of 80 pixels and a height of 20 pixels. 

You have to provide a date format Format$ which must be either "DDMMYYYY" for day, month, year or "MMDDYYYY" for month, day, year. Futhermore, you have to add a divider to the Format$ which can be either ".", "/" or "-". Thus, the default Format$ looks like this: "DDMMYYYY."

The SetDate$ should give the starting date in the format you have chosen. Default is the current day, when SetDate$ = "". Note: this SetDate$ has a different format than the yab command date$. However, it is not too difficult to convert these formats.

The calendar can be disabled or enabled with the option set command.

Layout:
In standard layout, the calendar will follow the lower, right corner of the view or window.

Example:
window open 100,100 to 300,200, "Example", "Example"
calendar 10,10, "MyCalendar", "MMDDYYYY/", "04.06.1975", "Example"
while(not quitting)
	if(instr(message$, "_QuitRequested")) then
		alert "You selected: "+calendar get$ "MyCalendar", "Duh", "info"
		quitting = true
	endif
wend
window close "Example"
Explanation:

In this example, a calendar is set on the window with an American date format, month, day, year and the / as separator. When the window is closed, an alert window shows the selected date with calendar get$.
