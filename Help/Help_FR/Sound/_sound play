Name:
sound play -- play a sound file

Synopsis:
Id = SOUND PLAY Filename$, loop

Description:
To play a sound file named Filename$ which can be of any supported format (e.g. WAV, MP3, etc.) sound play will return a number Id. Use Id to have basic control with the two other sound commands: sound wait and sound stop.

Design:
In a GUI context use sound wisely. Remember that not everyone can hear the sound, e.g. because sound is turned off, not supported or the user is deaf or hard-of-hearing. Thus, do not put important information for your application in speech files only. Additionally, remember that bells and whistles on each mouse click can become very annoying.

Example:
id = sound play "bach.mp3" , 1
while(1)
wend
Explanation:

This loads the file "bach.mp3" and then waits forever (use Ctrl-C or Break to end the program).
