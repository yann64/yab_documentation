Name:
// -- starts a comment

Synopsis: 
//  This is a comment! 

Description:
The double-slash ('//') is (besides REM and '#') the third way to start a comment. '//' is the latest and greatest in the field of commenting and allows yab to catch up with such cool languages like C++ and Java.

Example:
// Another comment. 
print "Hello world!" // Another comment 
Explanation:

Unlike the example given for '#' this example is syntactically correct and will not produce an error.
