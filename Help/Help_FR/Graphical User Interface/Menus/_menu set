Name:
menu set -- set options for the menu

Synopsis:
MENU SET MenuHead$, SetRadioMode, View$
MENU SET MenuHead$, MenuItem$, Option$, View$ 

Description:
This lets you set some options for the first level menu. 

Given a MenuHead$ you can put the entire menu in radio mode, i.e. only one item can be selected at a time. Set SetRadioMode to true to allow radio mode, set it to false to return to a normal behavior again. Note, you have to select the first item yourself after switching to radio mode. Use the following option to do so.

Given a MenuHead$ and a MeniItem$ you can disable or enable the item or you can select it by putting a mark to it or remove the mark again. Thus the following options are valid:


Option$ = "Disable" -- grey out the item so it cannot be selected anymore
Option$ = "Enable" -- enable a formerly disabled item again
Option$ = "Mark" -- mark this item
Option$ = "Plain" -- remove a mark again


Example:
window open 100,100 to 400,300, "Example", "Example"
menu "Test", "Foo", "", "Example"
menu "Test", "Bar", "", "Example"
menu set "Test", "Foo", "mark", "Example"
menu set "Test", "Bar", "disable", "Example"
fooMarked = true

menu "Radio", "1", "", "Example"
menu "Radio", "2", "", "Example"
menu "Radio", "3", "", "Example"
menu set "Radio", true, "Example"
menu set "Radio", "2", "mark", "Example"

while(not quitting)
	m$ = message$
	if(instr(m$, "Quit")) quitting = true
	if(instr(m$, "Foo")) then
		fooMarked = not fooMarked
		if(fooMarked) then
			menu set "Test", "Foo", "mark", "Example"
		else
			menu set "Test", "Foo", "plain", "Example"
		endif
	endif
wend
window close "Example"
Explanation:
The first menu has two items, the first item is selectable. As you see in the message loop you are responsable yourself to apply or remove the mark from this item. The second item is disabled.

The second menu is in radio mode, so only one item can be selected. The user will do that for you, however you have to select an item for the first time.
