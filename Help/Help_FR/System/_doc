Name:
doc -- special comment, which might be retrieved by the program itself

Synopsis: 
doc   This is a comment 
docu  This is another comment 

Description:
Introduces a comment, which spans up to the end of the line. But other than the rem-comment, any docu-comment is collected within the special docu$-array and might be retrieved later on. Moreover you might invoke yab -docu foo.yab on the commandline to retrieve the embedded documentation within the program foo.yab.
Instead of doc you may just as well write docu or even documentation.

Example:
rem   Hi, this has been written by me 
rem 
doc   This program asks for a number and 
doc   prints this number multiplied with 2 
rem 
rem   Print out rhe above message 
for a=1 to arraysize(docu$()):print docu$(a):next a 

rem   Read and print the number 
input "Please input a number: " x 
print x*2 
Explanation:

This program uses the comments within its code to print out a help message for the user.
The contents of the doc-lines are retrieved from the docu$-array; if you do not want a comment to be collected within this array, use the rem-statement instead.
