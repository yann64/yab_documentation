The restore-command may be used to reset the reading of data-statements, so that the next read-statement will read data from the first data-statement.
You may specify a label with the restore-command; in that case, the next read-statement will read data starting at the given label. If the label is omitted, reading data will begin with the first data-statement within your program.

Example:
input "Which language (German/English) ? " l$ 
if (instr("German",l$)>0) then 
	restore German 
else 
	restore English 
endif

Explanation:

This program asks to select one of those languages known to me (i.e. English or German) and then prints the numbers 1,2 and 3 and their textual equivalents in the chosen language.
