Name:
next -- mark the end of a for loop

Synopsis: 
for a=1 to 10 
next a 

Description:
The next-keyword marks the end of a for-loop. All statements up to the next-keyword will be repeated as specified with the for-clause. Note, that the name of the variable is optional; so instead of next a you may write next.

Example:
for a=1 to 300000 
	for b=1 to 21+20*sin(pi*a/20) 
		print "*" 
	next b 
	print 
	sleep 0.1 
next a 
Explanation:

This example simply plots a sine-curve until you fall asleep. Start this program in a terminal.
