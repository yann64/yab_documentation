Name:
translate$() -- translate a string on ZETA

Synopsis:
Translation$ = TRANSLATE$(Source$)

Description:
The counterpart to the localize command is translate$(). It translates the string Source$ according to known dictionaries (see localize for more information about dictionaries) into the language currently set as default in ZETA. 

Note: Currently localization is only supported on ZETA. However, supporting the localization of your program is a good idea for BeOS users too because localization support might be added soon to BeOS yab.

Example:
print translate$("File")
Explanation:
Using only the system dictionaries, we can obtain the translation of "File" according to the language set in the ZETA preferences.
