Name:
draw flush -- clear all prior draw commands

Synopsis:
DRAW FLUSH View$

Description:
Draw flush clears the view named View$ from all drawings.

In yab, all draw commands are stored in a list for every view. If the window is updated, e.g. when resized, all prior drawing is repeated. If you do a lot of drawing in a view, you might notice the redrawing due to flickering. if you want to clear your view, it is much better to clear it with draw flush than e.g. drawing a big rectangle over the other drawings. For flickerfree drawing consider to draw on a canvas instead of a view.

Note: This does not work for canvas and bitmaps.

Note: Widgets are not affected by draw flush.

Example:
window open 100,100 to 400,400, "Example", "Example"
draw line 0,0 to 300,300, "Example"
draw circle 100,50, 20, "Example"
draw rect 10,200 to 200,250, "Example"
sleep 1
draw flush "Example"
sleep 3
window close "Example" 
Explanation:

In this example, some things are drawn on the window and then cleared by the draw flush command.
