Name:
text -- create a text label

Synopsis:
TEXT x,y, ID$, Text$, View$
TEXT x1,y1 TO x2,y2, ID$, Text$, View$

Description:
The text command sets up a text label Text$ at the position (x,y) or (x1,y1) of the view named View$. Providing second coordinates (x2,y2) is useful for the alignment of the text, see text set for details. The text label has an ID$ which is needed for text set or for changing the text itself with option set.

So how does this compare to the draw text command? 
A text cannot be flushed and it will never flicker.
A text can be aligned.
The label of a text can change.
On a canvas only draw text can be used.
The font and color can only be changed for draw text.

Note: (x,y) is the upper left corner, this is different to draw text, where y is the baseline of the text.

Design:
Text should be used for labels on a view. Use the alignment to make clean interfaces.

Example:
window open 100,100 to 200,150, "Example", "Example"
text 10,10, "Text", "Hello World", "Example"

while(not instr(message$, "Quit"))
wend

window close "Example"
Explanation:

A simple yab program, just a window and a text label.
