Name:
bind() -- Binds a yab-program and the yab-interpreter together into a standalone program.

Synopsis:
bind("foo.exe")

Description:
The bind-command combines your own yab-program (plus all the libraries it does import) and the interpreter by copying them into a new file, whose name is passed as an argument. This new program may then be executed on any computer, even if it does not have yab installed.

Note: With the current version of yab, bind should not be used anymore, use the Build Factory instead.

Example:
if (!peek("isbound")) then 
	bind "foo" 
	print "Successfully created the standalone executable 'foo'!" 
	exit 
endif 

print "Hello World!" 
Explanation:

This example creates a standalone program foo from itself.
