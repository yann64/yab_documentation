# yab_documentation

Documentation for the yab programming language.

## Adding a new language

* First thing is to copy/paste one of the already available translation in the /Help folder and change its name. As an example, you can copy/paste Help_EN to Help_PT if you want to translate the english file to Portuguese. Every single file within the subfolders will have to be translated.
* You will then have to create the language data file ine the /data folder. Again, copy/paste the file from an existing language you are familiar with and start translating from there.
* Finally, you will need to create a catalog file in the /language folder. It is used to translate the yab_documentation gui in the desired language. To translate the French catalog file to Italian, copy the fr.catalog file to an it.catalog file and translate the newly created file to italian.
