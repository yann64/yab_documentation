Name:
xor() -- compute the exclusive or

Synopsis:
x=xor(a,b) 

Description:
The xor computes the bitwise exclusive or of its two numeric arguments. To understand the result, both arguments should be viewed as binary numbers(i.e. a series of 0 and 1); a bit of the result will then be 1, if exactly one argument has a 1 and the other has a 0 at this position in their binary representation.
Note, that both arguments are silently converted to integer values and that negative numbers have their own binary representation and may lead tounexpected results when passed to and.

Example:
print xor(7,4) 
Explanation:

  This will print 3. This result is obvious, if you note, that the binary representation of 7 and 4 are 111 and 100 respectively; this will yield 011 in binary representaion or 2 as decimal. The eor-function is the same as the xor function; both are synonymous; however they have each their own description, so you may check out the entry of eor for a slightly different view.
