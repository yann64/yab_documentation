Name:
end -- terminate your program

Synopsis:
end 

Description:
Terminate your program. Much (but not exactly) like the exit command.
Note, that end may not end your program immediately; if you have opened a window or called clear screen, yab assumes, that your user wants to study the output of your program after it has ended; therfore it issuesthe line ---Program done, press RETURN--- and waits for a key to be pressed. If you do not like this behaviour, consider using exit.

Example:
 
    print "Do you want to continue ?" 
    input "Please answer y(es) or n(o): " a$ 
    if (lower$(left$(a$,1))="n") then 
      print "bye" 
      end 
    fi
