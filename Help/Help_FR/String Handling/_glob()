Name:
glob() -- check if a string matches a simple pattern

Synopsis: 
if (glob(string$,pattern$)) ... 

Description:
The glob-function takes two arguments, a string and a (glob-) pattern, and checks if the string matches the pattern. However glob does not employ the powerful rules of regular expressions; rather it has only two special characters: * (which matches any number (even zero) of characters) and ? (which matches exactly a single character).

Example:
for a=1 to 10 
	read string$,pattern$ 
	if (glob(string$,pattern$)) then 
		print string$," matches ",pattern$ 
	else 
		print string$," does not match ",pattern$ 
	endif 
next a 

data "abc","a*" 
data "abc","a?" 
data "abc","a??" 
data "abc","*b*" 
data "abc","*" 
data "abc","???" 
data "abc","?" 
data "abc","*c" 
data "abc","A*" 
data "abc","????" 
Explanation:

This program checks the string abc against various patterns and prints the result. The output is:


abc matches a* 
abc does not match a? 
abc matches a?? 
abc matches *b* 
abc matches * 
abc matches ??? 
abc does not match ? 
abc matches *c 
abc does not match A* 
abc does not match ????
